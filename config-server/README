Overview
This application loads and makes the external configuration available to rest of the applications. Note that the external configuration
can be hosted either on GitHub or on local file system.

The respective applications pick up the configuration based on a <spring.application.name>.yml file defined in the configuration by
matching the service's spring.application.name property defined in the bootstrap.yml file.

Pre-requisites

Projects that need to be started before

This is the first application that needs to run since it pulls the configuration information(like what port to run etc) that is needed by rest of the applications to start.
